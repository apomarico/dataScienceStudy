The processor then parses that source data using that pattern and returns chunks of text back to the a data scientist or programmer for further manipulation. \n\nThe main reasons you would want to do this is:\n\n- to check whether a pattern exists within some source data\n\n- to get all instances of a complex pattern from some source data\n\n- to clean your source data using a pattern generally through string splitting. \n\nRegexes are not trivial, but they are a foundational technique for data cleaning in data science applications and a solid understanding of regexs will help you quickly and efficiently manipulate text data for further data science application."},{"metadata":{},"id":"eaeb5e63","cell_type":"markdown","source":"First we'll import the re module, which is where python stores regular expression libraries.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"id":"ce881aa6","cell_type":"code","source":"import re","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are several main processing functions in re that you might use:\n- match(pattern, string, flags=0) checks for a match that is at the beginning of the string and returns a boolean\n- search(pattern, string, flags=0) checks for a match anywhere in the string and returns a boolean\n- findall(pattern, string, flags=0) will look for a pattern and pull out all occurences.\n- split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0) split string by the occurrences of pattern."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#creating a text for an example\ntext = \"This is a good day.\"\nprint('text: ' + text)\nprint('----- MATCH ----')\nprint(re.match(\"This\", text))\nprint(re.match(\"this\", text))\nprint(re.match(\"this is\", text))\nprint('----- SEARCH ----')\nprint(re.search(\"good\", text))\nprint(re.search(\"a good day\", text))\nprint(re.search(\"bad\", text))\n\ntext2 = \"Amy works diligently.
